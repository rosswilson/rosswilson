### Hello there 👋

👨‍💻 During the day I'm doing software architecture things at Gumtree.

🔒 Previously I looked after the authentication and authorisation systems at the BBC that give users a personalised experience for services like BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds. The technology stack is a series of microservices, predominantly using Node.js and Java.

🙈 During the evening I'm tending to my graveyard of side-project ideas that one day might just see a 1.0.0 release.

If terms like OAuth2 and OIDC float your boat you might be interested in my [Turret](https://github.com/rosswilson/turret) project. It's shaping up to be a demonstration of an OIDC identity provider. I'm also looking an approach using Elixir, it's at [Turret Elixir](https://github.com/rosswilson/turret-elixir).
