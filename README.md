### Hello there 👋

During the day I'm doing software things at the BBC. Me and my team look after the authentication and authorisation systems that give users a personalised experience for services like BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds.

During the evening I'm tending to my graveyard of side-project ideas that just one day might see a 1.0.0 release.

If terms like OAuth2 and OIDC float your boat, you might be interested in my [Turret](https://github.com/rosswilson/turret) project. It's a demonstration of a OIDC provider.
