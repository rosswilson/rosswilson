### Hello there 👋

👨‍💻 During the day I'm doing software things at the BBC.

🔒 Me and my team look after the authentication and authorisation systems that give users a personalised experience for services like BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds. The technology stack is a series of microservices, predominantly using Node.is and Java.

💬 Ask me about the work going on at the BBC. I've been fortunate to work with a lot of teams and projects during my time here, and I'm always happy to chat.

🙈 During the evening I'm tending to my graveyard of side-project ideas that one day might just see a 1.0.0 release.

If terms like OAuth2 and OIDC float your boat you might be interested in my [Turret](https://github.com/rosswilson/turret) project. It's shaping up to be a demonstration of an OIDC identity provider. I'm also looking an approach using Elixir, it's at [Turret Elixir](https://github.com/rosswilson/turret-elixir).
