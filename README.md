### Hello there 👋

👨‍💻 During the day I'm doing software things at the BBC.

🔒 Me and my team look after the authentication and authorisation systems that give users a personalised experience for services like BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds.

🙈 During the evening I'm tending to my graveyard of side-project ideas that one day might just see a 1.0.0 release.

If terms like OAuth2 and OIDC float your boat you might be interested in my [Turret](https://github.com/rosswilson/turret) project. It's a demonstration of an OIDC provider.
